# Neural Embedding Operations

### Overview
This project demonstrates basic operations using **neural word embeddings**  
(Word2Vec and GloVe) to explore semantic relationships between words.

---

### Operations Implemented
1. **Word Similarity** – Compute similarity score between two words.
2. **Most Similar Words** – Retrieve top-N words most similar to a given word.
3. **Odd-One-Out (Doesn’t Match)** – Identify the word that doesn’t fit in a group.

### Embeddings Used
- **Word2Vec** (pretrained vectors via Gensim)
- **GloVe** (pretrained vectors via Gensim)


---

### Dataset
No dataset required — uses pretrained embedding files (Word2Vec/GloVe).
